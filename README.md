# Battleship

This project is my remake of the classic game Battleship where a user plays against an AI. Players take turns in guessing the location of opponent's ships with the goal of sinking all of the ships. I must admit this was the toughest thing I have ever written because of the amount of game logic needed and also the fact that this was my first ever React project. That being said I am very proud of the [result](https://johnjohncode.github.io/battleship/)
